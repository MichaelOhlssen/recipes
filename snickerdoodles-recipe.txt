Old Fashioned Snickerdoodles

1/2 cup butter
3/4 cup sugar
1 medium egg
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 2/3 cups flour
2 1/2 tablespoons sugar with 1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon ***

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Combine butter with sugar in large bowl. Add egg
and beat until creamy. Add baking powder, salt, and flour. Stir until mixture
forms thick dough. Put cinnamon-sugar mixture in small bowl. Shape dough into
1-inch balls. Roll balls in cinnamon-sugar mixture. Place on greased cookie
sheet, using bottom of cup, press balls to flatten slightly. Bake for 10
minutes.

*** This is way too much cinnamon. I don't know exactly how much
I use, but it's mostly sugar.

I use parchment paper instead of greased cookie sheet and flatten the cookies
more than slightly.

They're done when you can lift the edge of a cookie with a spatula. It's still
soft and just barely starting to turn golden brown on the bottom.

It takes about 12 to 13 minutes for me. Our oven may not be cooking them at 400
so maybe try 375.
